            <p> Be smart about your money
                Any solid resource of travel safety information will tell you that it's never a good idea to carry huge amounts of cash. Instead, open an account with an international bank or credit card company so you can use local ATMs. If you absolutely must withdraw large amounts of cash at once, leave the bulk of it locked up safely in your hotel or hostel and carry only what you'll need for the day.
                
                When using ATMs, try to use only those that are attached to banks as these are less likely to have been tampered with by scammers.
                
                Never keep all of your money in one place. Keep cash and credit cards in two or three different places so that if one of your stashes is stolen you aren't left completely empty-handed.</p>
